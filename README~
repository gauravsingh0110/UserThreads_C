This program is a library which a client can use to create
multi threaded program. This is implementation of user
level multi threading , that means that the kernel has no information
about multiple threads running inside the process . This means the
threads are completely managed in user space .
This is implemented using setjmp and longjmp functions of the gcc
library. These functions are used to store the current context (setjmp)
and restore the store context (longjmp) . 

These Programs are no where perfect but performs the task of giving multiple
points of control to the user.

For further instructions on how to use it and documentation refer to the 
documentation folder.
